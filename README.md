**NOTE: STACKSEARCH IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. There will still be the occasional bug fixes and updates, but not as much.**


StackSearch is a python module that provides a way to search [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

The reason this is better than other modules is that this module provides a modern API, a beautiful command-line interface via argparse and blessings, all in pure Python.

It is also available as a standalone command-line tool, so you may run it directly like so:

```bash
stacksearch This is the query
```

without the `python3 -m` prefix, if desired.

It also has an API which you can use via

```python
>>> from stackoverflow import Search
>>> Search.Search("This is the query")
```

Have fun!

## Benefits üëç

The benefits of this module as opposed to the other StackOverflow-searching modules is that this module provides the following:

- The ability to return a dictionary of _ALL_ the search results found, **not just the first result**
- The ability to return results from a variety of different [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) sites
- A **beautiful command-line interface _for humans_**
- A decently documented API
- An optional **asynchronous API**
- Decently easy-to-read code (formatted with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black))
- And **open source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThatXliner/stacksearch/tree/Stable)**

## Downsides üëé

- Possibly _slower_ than the other modules
- **The first PyPi project ever made by ThatXliner**
- Not _fully_ (completely) optimized (well, after all, it's python)
- ~~A big list of dependencies~~ (shortened in version 1.0.0 or so)

## Current Features üòÅ

- **Everything listed in the 'Benefits' section of the README above**
- Mostly, **if not fully**, [type-hinted](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/)
- A **beautiful, simple, yet powerful command-line interface** (via [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) and [blessings](https://pypi.org/project/blessings/))
- **Asynchronous** StackOverflow requests!
- The ability to **crank out raw [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data** to **_use_**
- And an **API**

## Future Features üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- [x] ~~Asynchronous StackOverflow requests!~~ (Done in v1.1.0)
- [x] [Documentation](https://stacksearch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (_Sort of_ added in v1.2.8)
- [ ] Object-oriented APIs
- [ ] Python backwards-compatibility
- [ ] Being able to scrape _all_ StackOverflow sites/pages
- [x] ~~A better README~~ (Done in v1.0.0.1)
- [ ] Being able to output different formats of data (e.g. YAML, TOML, XML, etc)
- [ ] And more command-line options

## Usage Examples

- For creating a text editor extension built on this package

- For searching StackOverflow and/or **other StackExchange websites** without leaving the Terminal (for those [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) people)

- For getting lots of answers from all StackExchange sites you know

## Code style guide üò≥

[Black](https://github.com/psf/black). We (I, right now.) use the black formatter to format our code. **It's pretty strict.**

We also use NumPy style docstrings.
